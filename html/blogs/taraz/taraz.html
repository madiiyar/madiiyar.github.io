                    Taraz (Kazakh: Тараз, تاراز, romanized: Taraz (listeni);
                     known to Europeans as Talas) is a city and the administrative center of 
                     Jambyl Region in Kazakhstan, located on the Talas (Taraz) River in the 
                     south of the country near the border with Kyrgyzstan. It had a population 
                     of 330,100 as of the 1999 census, up 9% from 1989, making it one of the fastest-growing
                      cities in the country, after Astana and Turkistan. The current population of Taraz city 
                      is 428,000 (April 2023).[1]
                    One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan and in Transoxania, built and populated by the ancient Sogdians,
                     Taraz celebrated its official 2,000th anniversary (recognized by UNESCO) in 2001, dating from a fortress
                      built in the area by a Xiongnu Chanyu named Zhizhi, and was a site of the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BCE.[2] 
                      The city was first recorded under the name "Talas" in 568 CE by Menander Protector. The medieval city of 
                      Talas was a major trade centre along the Silk Road. Talas was later described by Buddhist monk and traveller
                       Xuanzang, who passed Talas in 629 and later wrote: "Traveling westward from the Thousand Springs 140 or 150 
                       li, we come to the city of Daluosi. The city is 8 or 9 li in diameter; and was settled by Hu ("foreign, 
                       barbarian, non-Chinese") merchants from various nations. The products and the climate are about the same as 
                       Suyab."[3] The Talas alphabet, a variant of the Turkic "runiform" Orkhon script, is named for the town.
                    Talas secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas (751 CE), which was fought between forces
                     of the Chinese Tang dynasty and those of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. The battle took place somewhere along the 
                     Talas River in the Talas valley. One of its indirect outcomes was the introduction of paper to the West, via the Arab capture of Chinese paper makers.
